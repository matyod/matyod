## Interests
I'm interested in platforms that help me improve my programming skills

I recognize the importance of understanding Data Structures and Algorithms, and I'm currently mastering these topics to become a skilled software engineer.

## Portfolio Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
- Programming Principles: Solar Energy Billing System, Retail Price Calculation System
- Database: FONS Inventory System (focused on relational database design)
- Systems Analysis and Design: UNITAR Student Grading System
- Algorithms and Data Structures: Technical Assessment
- Object-Oriented Programming: Library Management System, Dungeon Adventure Game
- Internet Programming: Marine Debris Pollution Data Collection Web Form, Marine Plastic Recycling Awareness Website

These projects are coursework assignments I developed during my study. I am currently reworking them in my free time, using my preferred tech stack to ensure they are well-tested, documented, and ready for deployment on cloud platforms or VPS. My goal is to enhance their functionality and usability as I continue to learn and grow in my journey towards becoming a software engineer.
